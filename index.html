    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This paper reviews recent trends in closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for motor and cognitive rehabilitation and proposes a new paradigm that integrates artificial intelligence (AI)-based neurofeedback. Specifically, we examine how noninvasive BCI technology using electroencephalography (EEG) can interpret the user's brain state in real time and induce neuroplasticity through feedback. Unlike existing open-loop rehabilitation systems, the closed-loop architecture maximizes rehabilitation effectiveness through real-time interaction between the user's brain signals and the system. This paper summarizes application cases for motor and cognitive function recovery and analyzes the mechanisms by which AI algorithms enable personalized feedback. Finally, we discuss future research directions and clinical applications through a suggested model.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Motor and cognitive impairment due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, and degenerative neurological diseases is a serious social and medical problem worldwide...</p>

    <h2>2. Theoretical Background</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Basic Concepts of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)</h3>
